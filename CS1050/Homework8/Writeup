HW8 was a really fun assignment. Both reading from files and outputting to files was new, and was a good exercise 
in creating defensive try catch blocks to prevent the program from craching. I spent about 4 hours on this project, 
which was much less than HW7, but was great for building on the foundation of things that we have already been implementing.
Using scanner, defensive programming, and logical decomposition of problems were all concepts that we had to implement in earlier
projects, but that foundation helped make this assignment not so foreign. Even though I had to look up a few new methods
I wsa much more comfortable using try/catch and messing with specific exceptions versus the generic one. I'm looking
forward to implement JOptionPane and the GUIDemo when I have more time to continue to build on this experience. 
Great final project!
