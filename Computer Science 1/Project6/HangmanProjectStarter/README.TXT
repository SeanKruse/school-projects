Hangman Program Development

To run the hangman game,
invoke the main method of
either of the drivers,
HangmanGUI or HangmanConsole.

Each driver expects an implementation
of HangmanManager named Hangman.

The project directory contains a file
of candidate words (dictionary.txt)
and graphics files used by the
HangmanGUI driver (iconImage*.*).
