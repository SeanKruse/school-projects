A repository to organize and highlight all of my school projects. 

## Index
The courses are listed in chronological order, with newer projects closer to the top.
You can find more information on each project's individual README.

### Algorithms and Algorithm Analysis
The course focused on the application of computational complexity theory, to practice implementing different algorithms and understanding the upper and lower bounds in regards to complexity.

### Principles of Programming Languages
The course focused on the main programming paradigms, namely: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logical. Specific issues related to programming language implementation, such as nesting block structures, static and dynamic scoping, interpreted and compiled languages, among others were discussed in this course.
